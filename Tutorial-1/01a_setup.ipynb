    "1) **Code:** Python is an object-oriented interpreted script language, and all modern neural stuff is written almost exclusively in Python, so, we'll use this language for all coding assignments in this course as well. We will be working based on the latest Python and PyTorch versions. Despite that, there is no issue if you want to work with older Python/PyTorch versions. What is unworkable for me, however, is having to create a new environment in order grade each one of your deliverables. Hence, I would require that your submitted code runs <u>as delivered</u> on Google colab, to be fair and save time from everybody.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Report:** Regarding your reports, one word: **LaTeX**. I personally use TeXstudio (https://www.texstudio.org) for editing (and some compiler like https://miktex.org) when I'm solo, because it is native, fast, easy, works on all OSs, and Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com) otherwise. Of course, you are welcome to use anything you want, as long as your report is a .pdf produced by LaTeX, or, at least, is a very presentable one. <u>Do not</u> submit your report in, e.g., some Microsoft Word format, unless you are either feeling lucky, or are some wizard that makes it look as presentable as LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Deliverables:** Provide a <u>single</u> compressed file (.zip, .rar, etc.) that includes your report, and each programming exercise in a <u>separate</u> Python file (.ipynb or .py). Once ready, attach the compressed file to an e-mail and send it to the TA. You can use https://wetransfer.com in case you encounter any issues, e.g., large size. Do not forget to include your full name and registry number at both your report and the name of the submitted file. Submission instructions will likely be given at each assignment, but, even in case they are not, you can follow the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the three main things we require from you. If there is any problem regarding the above, contact the TA during our Friday tutorials 10:00-12:00 room H.206, or via e-mail at: mrap@csd.uoc.gr"

    "<b>Anaconda</b> (or just Conda) is an option for creating and managing virtual environments, with either its GUI, terminal, or both. Conda allows to you manage multiple Python installations at the same time, and in each of them you can have different libraries/packages. For instance, you may want to have a separate Conda environment for each assignment depending on its specific needs, although it probably won't be necessary for this course, except, perhaps, your project.\n",
